# SVD-product-recommendation

This project focuses on building a personalized product recommendation system for an electronics dataset using Collaborative Filtering and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The system is designed to recommend products to users based on their past ratings and the ratings of similar users. By analyzing existing user-item interactions, the model predicts which products a user might be interested in.

## Key Components

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Initial data analysis uncovered key trends, such as the distribution of ratings, unique counts of users and items, and identified the sparsity in user interactions.
- Visualizations showed the overall rating patterns and engagement levels, which guided the choice of model and approach.

### Collaborative Filtering using SVD
- **SVD** is employed to perform matrix factorization on the user-item interaction matrix, reducing it to a latent feature space.
- By representing both users and items as vectors in this reduced space, SVD helps uncover hidden relationships, such as which users are likely to rate similar items similarly.
- The model predicts a user's rating for an unrated item by taking the dot product of the user and item vectors in the latent space, thus facilitating personalized recommendations.

### FAISS for Scalability
- To make the recommendation system scalable, **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** is integrated to handle similarity searches efficiently.
- The SVD-generated item embeddings are indexed in FAISS, allowing fast retrieval of similar items, making it feasible to recommend products in real time.

### Interactive Recommendations
- Users can request recommendations by specifying a **user ID** or an **item ID**.
- The system dynamically finds and suggests items similar to those the user has rated highly, making recommendations more relevant and personalized.

## Benefits and Applications
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: SVD reduces the complexity of data processing by identifying important latent features that drive user preferences and item characteristics.
- **Efficient Scalability**: FAISS enables rapid similarity search, allowing the model to handle large datasets and generate recommendations quickly.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: By capturing hidden relationships, the system offers meaningful, personalized suggestions tailored to each user's preferences.

This project demonstrates the power of combining collaborative filtering (SVD) and FAISS for creating a scalable, efficient, and personalized recommendation system, suitable for e-commerce platforms aiming to enhance user engagement and product discovery.
